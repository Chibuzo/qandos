<!-- Our Story Section -->
<section class="story">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We were once meeting with a friend who had migrated to Canada with his family, and he shared stories of how a lot of Nigerians in Diaspora had fallen victim to investment scams even in the hands of friends, family and relatives. This was mostly particular to real estate-related investments.</p>
    <p>When we dug deeper, we realized that one of the major factors deterring a lot of Africans in diaspora from investing back home was the unavailability of a trusted and reliable platform they can feel safe with when making those real estate investment decisions.</p>
