                    h3 1. General Policy
                    p QANDOS operates a professional services model. Fees paid for completed services are generally non-refundable.
                    p However, fairness and transparency guide all decisions.

                    h3 2. Eligible Refund Situations
                    p Refunds may be considered where:
                    ul
                        li Payment was made in error
                        li Duplicate payment occurred
                        li Service cannot be delivered due to internal constraints
                        li Transaction cancelled before verification work begins
                    p Refunds are processed within 14–30 working days after approval.

                    h3 3. Non-Refundable Situations
                    p Fees are not refundable where:
                    ul
                        li Verification work has commenced or been completed
                        li Reports have been delivered
                        li Advisory sessions have been conducted
                        li Delays arise from client inaction or documentation issues
                        li Client withdraws after service execution begins

                    h3 4. Transaction-Based Services
                    p Secure acquisition and escrow facilitation fees may be partially refundable only if:
                    ul
                        li Transaction fails due to verified title defects discovered during QANDOS verification
                        li Failure is not caused by client withdrawal
                    p Each case is reviewed individually.

                    h3 5. How to Request Refund
                    p Send request to: info@qandos.com Include:

                        li Full name
