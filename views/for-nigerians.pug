                        h2 Affordable Options:
                        p At QANDOS, we offer real estate investment opportunities for all income levels. Whether you have a large budget for high-end properties, a mid-range budget for balanced investments, or a smaller budget for affordable housing, we have options to help you grow your wealth. Our flexible payment plans make it easy for you to start investing, no matter your financial situation.

                        h2 Flexible Payment Plans: 
                        p Installment Plans: Pay for a property in smaller amounts over time, making it easier to afford without paying the full amount upfront.

                        p Borrow money from a bank to buy property, then repay it over many years with interest, allowing you to own the property outright eventually.

                        p Pool money with other investors to buy property together, sharing ownership and profits based on your contribution.
